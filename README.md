- 👋 Hi, I’m @speudusa, or Courtney. speudusa, is a name I had from Latin class in high school.  It means 'Speedy Medusa'.  (Spe - du- sa)
- 👀 I’m interested in crafting: pen and ink, knitting, crocheting, embroidary, reading, parenting/adulting, gardening, tarot, and nature.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C#, JS, meditating (so hard), and tenacity.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on, i am not sure.  I have never done that before.  Anything related to keeping organized, managing projects or time are all close to my heart.
- 📫 How to reach me ... for now, use GitHub.
